        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I enjoy cooking, It's one of my favorite skills. I started to learn how to cook about 7 years ago in order to get a ski pass. From my childhood experiences of making random foods for myself when my parents were away. I knew I was very likely to get an entry job in the kitchen.</p>

        <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
        <p>Snowboarding is another activity that I'm really good at. I started learning how to snowboard the moment I recieved a pass from my job. I think it took me about 2 weeks to finally understand how to link turns. Now I don't even think about it, unless I'm going through some technical terrain.</p>
